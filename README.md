heya, this is for all of my different encryption codes as I follow through my module Introduction to Modern Cryptography.
So far I have two ongoing projects:
1. Using the Vignere cipher. I want to add further encryption such as using any ASCII characters and also having a binary output. I am planning on making some functions or modules to be able to implement on all my projects
2. Making an RSA encryption protocol. So far I have the key generation going, although ineffiently and now need to make a conversion function from base 10 to base 256 ASCII.
3. At some point I wish to have all my encryption protocols in the same program so that you can pick and choose or maybe combine several together
